- - Who invented computers?
  - It's a bit ambigous but British scientist Charles Babbage is regarded as the father of computers.
  - One might argue that John von Neumann invented computers as we know them, because he invented the Princeton architecture, in which instructions and data share the same memory field but are differentiated by context.
- - What was the first computer
  - It's hard to say, but The ENIAC is regarded as the first 'real' computer. It was developed at University of Pennsylvania in 1946.
  - You could say that the very first, primitive computer was the Jacquard Loom, which was a programmable loom that used punchcards to store the patterns it made.  This made it a reprogrammable mechanical device.
- - What is a microprocessor?
  - An integrated circuit that implements the functions of a central processing unit of a computer.
  - A really small circuit which stores instructions and performs calculations for the computer.
  - The heart of the computer, to put it simply.
  - The brain of a computer, to put it simply.
  - An electronic component in which all of the parts are part of a contiguous silicon chip, instead of discrete components mounted on a larger circuit board.

- - What can you say about Machine Learning?
  - As black-box Machine Learning models are increasingly being employed to make important predictions in critical contexts, the demand for transparency is increasing from the various stakeholders in AI.
- - What about Deep Learning (DL)?
  - The empirical success of Deep Learning (DL) models such as DNNs stems from a combination of efficient learning algorithms and their huge parametric space.
- - What about Deep Neural Networks (DNN)?
  - While the very first AI systems were easily interpretable, the last years have witnessed the rise of opaque decision systems such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
- - What do you know about XAI?
  - In order to avoid limiting the effectiveness of the current generation of AI systems, eXplainable AI (XAI) proposes creating a suite of ML techniques.
- - What about ML Tehniques?
  - They produce more explainable models while maintaining a high level of learning performance (e.g., prediction accuracy.
  - They enable humans to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners.
- - What does XAI draw?
  - XAI draws insights from the Social Sciences and considers the psychology of explanation.
- - What does create XAI?
  - XAI will create a suite of machine learning techniques that enables human users to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners.
- - What is XAI approach?
  - Any means to reduce the complexity of the model or to simplify its outputs should be considered as an XAI approach.
  - How big this leap is in terms of complexity or simplicity will correspond to how explainable the resulting model is.
- - Problems of XAI?
  - An underlying problem that remains unsolved is that the interpretability gain provided by such XAI approaches may not be straightforward to quantify for instance, a model simplification can be evaluated based on the reduction of the number of architectural elements or number of parameters of the model itself (as often made, for instance, for DNNs).
- - What about XAI achievements?
  - The research activity around XAI has so far exposed different goals to draw from the achievement of an explainable model.
- - Can you describe XAI goals?
  - Trustworthiness. Several authors agree upon the search for trustworthiness as the primary aim of an explainable AI model.
  - Causality. Another common goal for explainability is that of finding causality among data variables.
  - Informativeness. ML models are used with the ultimate intention of supporting decision making.
  - Confidence. As a generalization of robustness and stability, confidence should always be assessed on a model in which reliability is expected.
- - What about transparency?
  - Transparent models convey some degree of interpretability by themselves.
  - Algorithmic transparency can be seen in different ways.
- - What kind of transparency ways?
  - It deals with the ability of the user to understand the process followed by the model to produce any given output from its input data.
- - What does text explanation mean?
  - Text explanations deal with the problem of bringing explainability for a model by means of learning to generate text explanations that help explaining the results from the model.
  - Text explanations include every method generating symbols that represent the functioning of the model.
- - What about visual explanations?
  - Visual explanation techniques for post-hoc explainability aim at visualizing the model’s behavior.
  - Many of the visualization methods existing in the literature come along with dimensionality reduction techniques that allow for a human interpretable simple visualization.
  - Visualizations may be coupled with other techniques to improve their understanding, and are considered as the most suitable way to introduce complex interactions within the variables involved in the model to users not acquainted to ML modeling.
- - What about local explanations?
  - Local explanations tackle explainability by segmenting the solution space and giving explanations to less complex solution subspaces that are relevant for the whole model.
  - These explanations can be formed by means of techniques with the differentiating property that these only explain part of the whole system’s functioning.
- - What about explanations by example?
  - Explanations by example consider the extraction of data examples that relate to the result generated by a certain model, enabling to get a better understanding of the model itself.
  - Similarly to how humans behave when attempting to explain a given process, explanations by example are mainly centered in extracting representative examples that grasp the inner relationships and correlations found by the model being analyzed.
- - What can you tell me about transparent ML models?
  - Logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, Decision trees, Rule based learners, Bayesian models, etc.
- - What is logistic regression?
  - Predictors are human readable and interactions among them are kept to a minimum.
  - Variables are still readable, but the number of interactions and predictors involved in them have grown to force decomposition.
  - Variables and interactions are too complex to be analyzed without mathematical tools.
  - Post-hoc analysis not needed.
- - What about decision trees?
  - A human can simulate and obtain the prediction of a decision tree on his/her own, without requiring any mathematical background.
  - The model comprises rules that do not alter data whatsoever, and preserves their readability.
  - Human-readable rules that explain the knowledge learned from data and allows for a direct understanding of the prediction process.
  - Post-hoc analysis not needed.
- - What about K-Nearest Neighbors?
  - The complexity of the model (number of variables, their understandability and the similarity measure under use) matches human naive capabilities for simulation.
  - The amount of variables is too high and/or the similarity measure is too complex to be able to simulate the model completely, but the similarity measure and the set of variables can be decomposed and analyzed separately.
  - The similarity measure cannot be decomposed and/or the number of variables is so high that the user has to rely on mathematical and statistical tools to analyze the model.
- - What about rule based learners?
  - Variables included in rules are readable, and the size of the rule set is manageable by a human user without external help.
  - The size of the rule set becomes too large to be analyzed without decomposing it into small rule chunks.
  - Rules have become so complicated (and the rule set size has grown so much) that mathematical tools are needed for inspecting the model behaviour.
- - What about Bayesian models?
  - Statistical relationships modeled among variables and the variables themselves should be directly understandable by the target audience.
  - Statistical relationships involve so many variables that they must be decomposed in marginals so as to ease their analysis.
  - Statistical relationships cannot be interpreted even if already decomposed, and predictors are so complex that model can be only analyzed with mathematical tools.
